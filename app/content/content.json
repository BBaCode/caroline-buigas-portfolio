        "findings": "Because Costco and Floward service different markets and general products, they would be indirect competitors SweetBud which would be serving users within the USA and also providing only floral arrangements and not any other gifts such as snack baskets. Bouqs is a higher cost option for floral arrangments within this market. Finally, 1800Flowersâ€™ website is not seamless to use and has a very broad selection range. Thus, a gap in the market is a service that offers users the ability to easily customize bulk floral arrangements at a mid range cost."
